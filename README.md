# U.S-Census-Project
This project is a Linear Regression project. 
I have merged five us census csv files of data organized by zip code to identify trends that may be deemed as noteworthy from a business perspective. 
I have tried to understand the basic demographics , social, economic factors of the population in the U.S and made linear regression model to predict the count of families who are earning less than $25K annually in for all zipcodes.
